         <h2>FUNCTION:</h2>
<p>YouTube is a free video sharing website that allows users to watch, 
    like, share, comment, and upload their own videos. It's available on computers, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones. 
    YouTube's main function is to allow 
    people to create and share content
     with others. It's also a social media platform that allows for two-way communication between brands and their audiences. Brands can use YouTube to engage with their audiences through comments and live streams, which can help build brand loyalty and create a sense of community. 
    YouTube was created in 2005 and is now one of the most popular websites on the internet, 
    with users watching around 6 billion hours of video every month. </p>
